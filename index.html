            Meet Chase, an ambitious and driven individual who has faced
            challenges head-on and emerged victorious. In 2014, Chase
            experienced a life-changing injury that forced them to shift gears
            and change careers. Rather than giving up, Chase took the leap and
            started his own business with his brother. As Chase built their
            business, they realized that building apps to support their work was
            costly and they needed to learn to do it themselves. Driven by their
            determination to succeed, Chase dove headfirst into the world of
            programming, enrolling in a coding bootcamp. They took quickly to
            HTML and CSS but realized that they needed to expand their skillset
            and began to explore the world of JavaScript. Though new to the
            language, Chase is eager to learn. Off the clock, Chase enjoys
            spending time with friends and family, pursuing their passion for
            travel, and exploring new hobbies. Their determination and positive
            attitude make them a joy to be around, and they approach every
            challenge with a smile and a can-do attitude.
